**PROS ⚡**
- [x] Easy to use chat interface
- [x] Conversation history
- [x] Recognize user intents and responds

**CONS ⚠️**

- [ ] Login not avaliable
- [ ] So history of all users is stored at one place which means your chat history with chatbot is visible for everyone, therefore i am requesting you to delete the chat history. This drawback will be resolved in future.
